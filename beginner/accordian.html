        const qaData = [
            {
                "question": "When does the website re-render in vanilla JavaScript?",
                "answer": "It doesn't re-render in the React sense. Instead, specific DOM elements are updated directly using methods like classList.add() or innerHTML."
            },
            {
                "question": "How do I toggle tab visibility with vanilla JavaScript?",
                "answer": "Use classList.add('active') and classList.remove('active') to show or hide the correct content div based on which tab was clicked."
            },
            {
                "question": "What does useRef do in React?",
                "answer": "useRef returns an object with a .current property that persists across renders without causing re-renders when updated. It's often used for storing DOM refs or mutable values like timers."
            },
            {
                "question": "How is memoization achieved in useMemo?",
                "answer": "React stores the result of a function and its dependencies. On re-render, it checks if the dependencies changed. If not, it returns the cached result instead of recomputing."
            },
            {
                "question": "What is the difference between local and global state?",
                "answer": "Local state is managed within a component using useState, while global state is shared across components and managed using libraries like Zustand or Redux."
            },
            {
                "question": "What does React.memo do?",
                "answer": "React.memo memoizes a component, preventing it from re-rendering unless its props change. It performs a shallow comparison by default."
            },
            {
                "question": "How do I implement hover-based star rating in React?",
                "answer": "Track both the selected rating and hovered rating with useState. On hover, temporarily highlight stars using conditional logic and revert to the selected rating on mouse leave."
            },
            {
                "question": "What is the purpose of data-tab in tab buttons?",
                "answer": "data-tab is a custom attribute used to store the target content ID. JavaScript reads this attribute to show the correct content when a button is clicked."
            },
            {
                "question": "Why is my interval timer not stopping in React?",
                "answer": "You must store the interval ID in a useRef so it persists across renders. Then call clearInterval(intervalRef.current) and reset it to null to stop the timer properly."
            },
            {
                "question": "How does pnpm differ from npm?",
                "answer": "pnpm uses symlinks and a global content-addressable store to save disk space and install faster. npm installs a flat node_modules structure but duplicates packages more often."
            }
        ]

        qaData.forEach((pair, index) => {
            document.write(`<p class = "questions" index = "${index}"><strong>Q:</strong> ${pair.question}<br></p><p id = "${index}" class = "answers"><strong>A:</strong> ${pair.answer}</p>`);

In js
1. counter --> learned to use event handlers. How to combine js and html in a simple manner. waiting for the DOMContent to load.
2. stopwatch --> learned setInterval() for have a certain functions run at periodic intervals. Use clearInterval to stop the function from running. 
3. rating --> foreach loop (takes in 3 things (current item, current index, full array )=> callback )
4. tabs --> you can create random identifies inside divs? 
5. accordian --> just had to figure out how to get html to be created with js similiar to react. foreach in js but use map in react but foreach does not return anything and react returns jsx. map returns an array of jsx elements. foreach returns undefined. 
6. traffic light --> used settimeout for this one.
7. progress bars --> setinterval to increment that bars
8. holy grail --> honestly gave up, too much css needed.


in react:
1. counter --> usestate
2. stopwatch --> used usestate to update the timer and then used setinterval to measure time. useref to store the interval function across renders.
3. rating --> map to create an array of stars, use state for the array of stars
4. Tabs --> learned you can use booleans as state variables for conditional loading. first time the state wasn't something "visible"
5. accordian --> similiar logic to tabs. wrap the map function in curly brackets.
6. traffic light
